The rightmost columns explains how we determined a path. A dash prefix indicates that this hop was determined from the same segment as an earlier hop.
dst - This hop is the destination or the destination's uplink.
sym - We had to assume this hop was symmetric to the forward traceroute in order to generate the path. Note that we always assume that hop1, the destination's uplink, is symmetric, in order to avoid excess probing of endhosts. This assumption will generally be true for endhosts.
tr - This hop was determined from an intersection with a known traceroute.
rr - We used the Record Route option of the Internet Protocol to find this hop.
ts - We used the Timestamp option of the Internet Protocol to find this hop.
